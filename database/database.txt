This module contains all code and files for the database and it's API. The Mqtt listener provided by the Paho Mqtt package is defined in 'receive_data.py'. This file connects to the Mqtt broker providing the data which is read by the sensors in the data center. It uses TLS encryption to make sure the connection can not be compromised.
The file uses the class 'reading_class' from the file 'reading_class.py' to format the incoming data and make it writeable to the database. Finally, the 'db_writer.py' file is addressed to connect to the database and write the data. This connection is set up with the PyMongo package. To secure this connection none of the database credentials are used directly in the code. They are stored somewhere on the system and can be read by Python's configparser module. The creation of a config file can be done with the file 'create_config.py'.
The 'test.py' file can be used to insert data into the database when there is no incoming data stream yet, or even for some troubleshooting.
